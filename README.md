# PoGoProxyCheck

A brief script that will produce files of working and not working proxies for Pokemon Go. This will allow users to quickly test mass volumne of proxies that companies prodive to ensure that work and dont need returning.

You will get the follwiing possible folder:

- ok.txt
- banned.txt
- wrong_status.txt
- timeout.txt
- failed_connection.txt

I have used the same style and flow as in https://github.com/sebastienvercammen/PoGoAccountCheck which i have forked with proxy support https://github.com/georgeherby/PoGoAccountCheck
